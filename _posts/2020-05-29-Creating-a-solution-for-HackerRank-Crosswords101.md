I was wanting to exercise my functional programming muscles, so I thought I would tackle a HackerRank puzzle as they have a wide variety of problems that have already been thought out and are easy to just pick up and chew on.

I wanted something a bit meatier than an easy problem and scrolling through the list I came across an Advanced level problem that sounded interesting.

Even though I use F#, which supports mutation, I wanted to set myself the limitation of being purely functional.
