Another Microsoft Dynamics NAV Reseller but this time based in Livingston, Scotland.
They created a vertical add-on for NAV targeted at the UK construction industry. And the software managed data such as Subcontractor, Projects, Onsite Material Requisitions and Tax and other Financial obligations laid out by the [CIS legislation](https://www.gov.uk/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme).

However, there were a few customers that didn't use the add-on and just wanted a custom install of NAV specifically for their business.

Wrote some .NET based custom controls for doing embedded charts.
Wrote a .NET application for PDAs that allowed onsite subcontractors to requisition goods directly from plots. This used .NET CE, MSMQ, SOAP WebServices and NAV Application Server.

### EasiRun
2000 - 2004

Microsoft Dynamics NAV Reseller based in Benoni, South Africa.
My first job after graduating from Van Zyl and Pritchard that I got by recommendation from the college's student placement office.

Built custom NAV solutions for over 100 different customers.
The majority of the customers were in the manufacturing and construction industries.
But we did have customers that were in car sales, furniture sales, healthcare administration and other admin\sales focused verticals.

We picked up the brand new .NET 1.0 framework as a foundation to start writing integration products using MSMQ as a message bus.
